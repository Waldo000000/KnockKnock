# KnockKnock

A partial implementation of a simple little API (particularly [MyRedPill.svc.cs](https://github.com/Waldo000000/KnockKnock/blob/master/MyRedPillWebRole/MyRedPill.svc.cs)), written to match the behavior of a reference WCF service, provided as part of an initial stage of a certain company's recruitment process. Just playing around.
